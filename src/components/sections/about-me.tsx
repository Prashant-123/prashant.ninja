          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a passionate and experienced Software Development Engineer specializing in
            Android development. With a strong background in developing and maintaining
            high-performance applications, I bring over 5+ years of professional experience
            working with cutting-edge technologies and frameworks.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            My journey in the world of Android development began in July 2018 with my college app,
            where I designed and developed an Android app which offers multiple login (Admin,
            Teacher and Student), attendance, events, timetable, notes, etc. This initial experience
            laid the foundation for my passion for building user-friendly and high-performance
            mobile applications. <br />
            Let&apos;s NOT checkout the code, it&apos;s a mess ðŸ˜…, but also a reason for me being
            here an Android Developer.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through my{" "}

            blog and contributing to the developer community. Feel free to explore my portfolio to
            see more of my work. And, sometimes you can find me in a pool, playing badminton, or
            going on a trip. Oh btw, don&apos;t forget to check out my{" "}
